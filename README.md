# Root-Finder

This software has been written in Visual Basic and it aims to find the roots of a quadratic equation of the form **ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0**.

The software takes in input all the coefficients and displays the roots along with their nature ie. Imaginary,equal or distinct.

The interface of the software comprises of the equation and 3 input boxes `a`,`b`,`c`. the user enters the values of the coefficients as decimals or integers in order of `a`,`b`,`c` in the equation **ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0**

The user can set the precision to be **`0`**,**`3`** or **`6`** with the default value being **`3`**. If the input passes the testing(i.e. overflow,characters other than numbers etc) (green ticks appear next to input text box) and if the testing is not passed then error providers appear next to each input text box.

Then the user is allowed to choose from the following five options:
1. **Show Answer** - Directly shows the roots of the given equation
2. **Visualise** - A step by step guide to the solution
3. **Graph** - A graph of the quadratic equation
4. **Clear** - Clears all the coefficients
5. **Exit** - To exit the program
