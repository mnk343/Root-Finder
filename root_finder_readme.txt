This is a software which allowes the user to calculate the roots of a given quadratic equation.

The interface of the software comprises of the equation and 3 input boxes a,b,c. the user enters the values of the coefficients as decimals or integers in order of a,b,c in the equation ax2+bx+c=0.
The user is given an oppurtunity to choose how many places(from 0,3,6) after the decimal would he want the solution to have. the default value is 3,whereas he change change it to 0 or 6. If the input passes the testing(i.e. overflow,characters other than numbers etc) (green ticks appear next to input text box) and if the testing is not passed then error providers appear next to each input text box .Then the user is allowed to choose from the following three options:
		1. Show Answer(just to show the answer)
		2. Visualise(to see the solution step by step)
		3. Graph(to see the graph of the quadratic expression)

	If user clicks any one of these buttons without green ticks for all inputs there will be a message box saying to input correct input

	If the user clicks Show Answer then the roots appear one after other with a small time gap. And the nature of the roots will be described in a colour for each type of roots.

	If user clicks Visualize then the whole solution will apper in 3 steps. but only the first step will appear along with 3 buttons namely Previous, See Again, Next. The user can travel through the steps using the buttons previous and next. And each line of the step appears one after another with a small time gap. the user is also allowed to repeat each step using the button See Again( if the user clicks previous button when on step 1 the will be a message box popped up saying so). 

	If user clicks Graph then a chart showing the graph of the quadratic expression appears.

The user may enter the values which will pass through the 1st testing but will not form a quadratic equation. All these cases will fall into 3 cases
		1. a=0,b≠0 (linear equation)
		2. a=0,b=0,c=0 (infinitely many solutions)
		3. a=0,b=0,c≠0 (no solutions)
	If the user wants to know the solution for any one of these cases, a message box will appear showing that it doesn't form a quadratic equation. However the solution to each of these cases will also be shown.

The user can clear all the values to start a new problem by clicking the button Clear( this will even clear the solution). And when this butto is clicked there will be a message box showing that all the values are cleared and the error providers next to each input show up.
If the user clicks Clear even when all the values are already empty there will be a message box saying so.
